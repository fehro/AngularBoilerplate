# AngularBoilerplate
A boilerplate application with Angular, Bootstrap, Gulp, etc ready to go :)

### Usage

1) Run the following commands in the / directory to install Gulp and the required dependencies (make sure Node is install first :)

```sh
npm install gulp
npm install gulp-sass
npm install gulp-rimraf
npm install gulp-bundle-assets
```

2) Open the / directory with VS Code. Press Ctrl + Shift + B to start up Gulp.

3) Point IIS to the /app folder.

Any changes you make in the /src folder will rebundle and copy your code to /app/dist
